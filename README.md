# B2B-Ticketing-Platform-Data-Analysis-in-SQL

## Design a reporting system that will help decision-makers analyze business results and the needs of selling event tickets.

    1) Venue organizers sell venue tickets. Resellers can also sell venue tickets.
    2) For each ticket, a reseller gets a commission.
    3) The commission is set by a partnership agreement and it is defined as a percentage fee per each sold ticket, e.g. 10%. For the sake of simplicity, we will leave it as a flat percentage fee.
    4) Customers can buy tickets from a venue organizer or a reseller.
    5) Resellers can have multiple branches offices or sell on their websites, while venue organizers can sell on-site or online.

###### Step1 - Define a simple transactional database

###### Step2 - Insert sample data for the transactional database

###### Step3 - Implement the ETL process and create the BI data layer that will be used for reporting purposes

###### Step4 - Report/business requirements:
               ● Compare sales results by weeks and by channels (Example: if sales results in Feb 2021 are better than results in Feb 2020? And drill it by resellers and event types).
               ● Comparison if the commission rate is in relation to sales results.
               ● Most popular tickets per offices, resellers.
