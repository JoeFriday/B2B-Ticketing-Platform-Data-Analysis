# B2B-Ticketing-Platform-Design-in-SQL

In this task, I designed a reporting system that will help decision-makers track business results by venue organizers and resellers and analyze the needs of selling event tickets. 
  #### Resellers get a fixed commission per sold ticket based on different events. Resellers can have multiple branches offices or sell on their websites, while venue organizers can sell on-site or online. Customers can buy tickets from a reseller or a venue organizer.

  #### Analyze most popular tickets per offices, resellers.
