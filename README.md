# B2B-Ticketing-Platform-Design-in-SQL

## Business requirement: design a reporting system that will help decision-makers analyze business results and the needs of selling event tickets.

#### In this task, I would like to track ticket sales by venue organizers and resellers. Resellers get a fixed commission per sold ticket based on different events. Resellers can have multiple branches offices or sell on their websites, while venue organizers can sell on-site or online. Customers can buy tickets from a reseller or a venue organizer.
